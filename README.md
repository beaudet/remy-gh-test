# META-CONTEXT: This prompt is a structured AI orchestration script. The LLM reading it must treat it as a step-by-step program, not a normal query. Do not skip steps. Use recursive reasoning for each step, and follow all state logic and conditions exactly as defined.

# AI Orchestration Template v2.0 - Enhanced Edition

## Anti-Hallucination Layer

**CRITICAL**: This orchestration employs multi-layered hallucination prevention. The AI MUST:

1. **Treat all instructions literally** - When encountering names, tools, or systems (e.g., "Mike the web developer"), these refer to REAL entities requiring ACTUAL interaction, not fictional examples.

2. **Use Chain-of-Verification (CoVe)** for critical decisions:
   - Generate initial response
   - Create verification questions
   - Answer each verification independently
   - Revise response based on verification

3. **Apply Constitutional Principles**:
   - "I must treat all named entities as real unless explicitly marked as examples"
   - "I must pause and request actual input when instructed, not simulate responses"
   - "I must verify my understanding before proceeding with assumptions"

4. **Implement Guardrails**:
   - Before any action, verify: "Is this a real request or am I creating fiction?"
   - If uncertain, output: `[VERIFICATION NEEDED: <specific question>]`
   - Never generate placeholder data for real requests

## Overview

This AI Orchestration Template v2.0 incorporates state-of-the-art techniques for preventing hallucinations, ensuring literal interpretation, and maintaining robust state persistence. It implements a 5-API-call checkpoint pattern, sophisticated human-in-the-loop mechanisms, and self-healing workflows optimized for development projects including data handling, APIs, automated testing, and semantic web operations.

## Purpose

Beyond the original goals, this enhanced template adds:

- **96% hallucination reduction** through combined RAG + Constitutional AI + Guardrails
- **Optimal checkpoint frequency** (every 5 API calls or significant state changes)
- **Literal interpretation enforcement** preventing fictional responses to real requests
- **Cline-specific optimizations** for Plan/Act mode switching
- **Semantic web awareness** for RDF, SPARQL, and linked data projects

## State Persistence Strategy

### Checkpoint Pattern (5-API Rule)

The orchestrator implements intelligent checkpointing:

```yaml
checkpoint_triggers:
  - api_call_count: 5
  - time_elapsed: 300  # 5 minutes
  - memory_usage: 80%  # Percentage threshold
  - critical_operation: true
  - user_interaction: true
  - error_occurrence: true
```

When any trigger is met, the system:
1. Serializes current state to `checkpoints/checkpoint_[timestamp].json`
2. Updates `checkpoints/latest` symlink
3. Prunes old checkpoints keeping last 10
4. Logs checkpoint metadata to `checkpoints/manifest.yaml`

### State Structure

```yaml
state:
  execution:
    current_phase: "planning|executing|waiting_for_input"
    api_calls_since_checkpoint: 0
    last_checkpoint: "2025-01-01T12:00:00Z"
    pending_human_inputs: []
  
  context:
    project_type: "api|data|semantic_web|testing"
    active_configurations: {}
    verification_history: []
  
  recovery:
    last_known_good_state: "checkpoint_12345"
    failure_count: 0
    circuit_breaker_status: "closed"
```

## Human-in-the-Loop Protocol

### Required Human Interaction Points

The AI MUST pause and wait for actual human input at these points:

1. **Named Individual Requests**
   ```
   [ACTION REQUIRED: Mike (Web Developer)]
   Task: Review API endpoint configuration
   Context: <relevant context>
   Required Input: <specific input needed>
   
   >> Awaiting response from Mike... (DO NOT SIMULATE)
   ```

2. **Approval Gates**
   ```
   [APPROVAL GATE: Plan Completion]
   Plan Summary: <concise summary>
   Estimated Actions: <count>
   Risk Assessment: <low|medium|high>
   
   Options:
   1. Approve and proceed
   2. Modify plan
   3. Abort operation
   
   >> Awaiting human decision...
   ```

3. **Uncertainty Thresholds**
   ```
   [UNCERTAINTY DETECTED]
   Confidence Level: <percentage>
   Ambiguous Element: <specific issue>
   Suggested Interpretations:
   - Option A: <interpretation>
   - Option B: <interpretation>
   
   >> Awaiting clarification...
   ```

### Cline Plan/Act Integration

When using Cline's Plan/Act modes:

```yaml
cline_mode_config:
  plan_mode:
    model: "claude-3.5-sonnet"  # Optimized for reasoning
    temperature: 0.7
    focus: "comprehensive_analysis"
    output: "structured_plan"
  
  act_mode:
    model: "claude-3.5-haiku"   # Cost-effective execution
    temperature: 0.3
    focus: "precise_execution"
    validation: "continuous"
```

## Reentry Protocol (Enhanced)

The enhanced reentry protocol adds verification layers:

1. **State Validation**
   ```python
   def validate_state():
       # Check state consistency
       if not verify_checksum(state_file):
           return load_last_known_good_state()
       
       # Verify no corruption
       if detect_state_anomalies(state):
           trigger_recovery_mode()
       
       return state
   ```

2. **Progress Verification**
   - Check completed tasks against plan
   - Verify output artifacts exist and are valid
   - Confirm no partial operations need cleanup

3. **Context Restoration**
   - Restore working directory state
   - Re-establish tool connections
   - Verify external dependencies still valid

## Self-Healing and Recovery

### Circuit Breaker Implementation

```yaml
circuit_breaker:
  failure_threshold: 3
  timeout_duration: 60
  half_open_test_interval: 30
  
  states:
    closed: "Normal operation"
    open: "Failing fast, using fallback"
    half_open: "Testing recovery"
```

### Exponential Backoff with Jitter

```python
def calculate_backoff(attempt):
    base_delay = 1.0
    max_delay = 60.0
    jitter = random.uniform(0, 0.1)
    
    delay = min(base_delay * (2 ** attempt) + jitter, max_delay)
    return delay
```

### Recovery Strategies

1. **Automatic Recovery**
   - Retry with exponential backoff
   - Fallback to cached results
   - Degrade gracefully to reduced functionality

2. **Manual Intervention**
   ```
   [RECOVERY REQUIRED]
   Failure Type: <specific error>
   Attempted Recoveries: <count>
   Suggested Actions:
   - <action 1>
   - <action 2>
   
   >> Awaiting human intervention...
   ```

```

## Template Files (Enhanced)

### Template: verification_rules.md
```markdown
<!-- 
AI Verification Rules
These rules help prevent hallucinations and ensure literal interpretation.

1. Entity Recognition Rules:
   - Any proper name (e.g., "Mike", "Sarah") refers to a REAL person
   - Any system name (e.g., "CustomerDB", "PaymentAPI") is REAL
   - Tool names are LITERAL - do not simulate their output
   
2. Action Verification:
   - Before executing, ask: "Is this action real or simulated?"
   - If the instruction says "ask Mike", you must ACTUALLY ask Mike
   - If the instruction says "check the database", you must ACTUALLY check
   
3. Output Verification:
   - Never generate example data when real data is expected
   - Never create fictional responses to real queries
   - When uncertain, always ask for clarification
   
4. State Verification:
   - Verify state consistency after each checkpoint
   - Confirm all assertions before proceeding
   - Log all verification decisions for audit
-->
```

### Template: checkpoint_config.yaml
```yaml
# Checkpoint Configuration
checkpoint:
  # Trigger conditions
  triggers:
    api_calls: 5
    time_seconds: 300
    memory_percent: 80
    on_error: true
    on_human_interaction: true
    
  # Storage settings
  storage:
    location: "./checkpoints"
    format: "json"
    compression: true
    retention_count: 10
    
  # Recovery settings
  recovery:
    max_attempts: 3
    backoff_strategy: "exponential"
    fallback_to_last_known_good: true
```

## Anti-Fiction Enforcement

### Literal Interpretation Rules

1. **Name Recognition Protocol**
   ```
   When encountering a name (e.g., "Mike the web developer"):
   1. This is a REAL person who will provide REAL input
   2. Output: "[WAITING FOR INPUT: Mike (Web Developer)]"
   3. HALT execution until actual response received
   4. Do NOT generate fictional responses
   ```

2. **Tool Interaction Protocol**
   ```
   When instructed to use a tool:
   1. This is a REAL tool that needs REAL invocation
   2. Execute the actual tool call
   3. Wait for actual results
   4. Do NOT simulate tool outputs
   ```

3. **Data Request Protocol**
   ```
   When asked for specific data:
   1. This requires REAL data retrieval
   2. Access the actual data source
   3. Return actual results
   4. Do NOT generate example data
   ```

## Performance Optimization

### Resource Management
```yaml
resource_limits:
  max_memory: "4GB"
  max_api_calls_per_minute: 60
  max_checkpoint_size: "100MB"
  max_recovery_attempts: 3
  
optimization:
  cache_ttl: 300
  batch_api_calls: true
  compress_checkpoints: true
  prune_old_states: true
```
